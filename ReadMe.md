LeetCode Roadmap 2025

### Step 1: Build your foundations

- Arrays and Strings

- Hash Maps and Sets

- Two Pointers

- Sliding Window

### Step 2: Learn algorithmic patterns


* Binary Search
* Depth-First and Breadth-First Search
* Recursion and Backtracking
* Dynamic Programming (Top-down and Bottom-up)
* Greedy algorithms

### Step 3: Go company-specific

* Focus on high-frequency problems tagged by company

* Solve them by category (e.g., all Google dynamic programming questions)

* Repeat difficult ones until the logic is intuitive

### Step 4: Simulate real interviews

* LeetCode Contest Archives

* Mock interviews 

* Platforms like Pramp or [Interviewing.io](https://www.educative.io/blog/Interviewing.io)

### Step 5: Reflect, refine, and repeat

* What did I miss in my first approach?

* How can I optimize my solution?

* Can I explain this problem to someone else?


### Step 6: Tackle timed challenges and contests

* Time management practice

* Real-world feedback on your speed and accuracy

* Competitive ranking to benchmark progress

### Step 7: Master advanced topics

* Tries and Segment Trees

* Union-Find

* Topological Sorting

* Bit Manipulation

* Advanced Dynamic Programming (memoization tables, state reduction)

### Step 8: Create a review cycle

* Reattempt tough problems after 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks

* Record new insights from each attempt

* Maintain a ‚Äúfail list‚Äù as part of your dashboard

## Good tips
* Study from top solutions and editorials
* Build your own problem list
* Don‚Äôt neglect behavioral prep
* Join a community for accountability
* Balance LeetCode with project work
